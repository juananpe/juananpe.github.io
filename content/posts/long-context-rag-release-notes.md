Explore the synergy between long context models and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in this episode of the Release Notes podcast. Google DeepMind's Nikolay Savinov joins host Logan Kilpatrick to discuss scaling context windows into the millions, recent quality improvements, RAG versus long context, and what's next in the field.

## Episode Summary

- **Defining tokens and context windows:** What is a token, and why do LLMs use them? How does tokenization affect model behavior and limitations?
- **Long context vs. RAG:** When is RAG still necessary, and how do long context models change the landscape for knowledge retrieval?
- **Scaling context windows:** The technical and economic challenges of moving from 1M to 10M+ tokens, and what breakthroughs are needed.
- **Quality improvements:** How recent models (Gemini 1.5 Pro, 2.5 Pro) have improved long context quality, and what benchmarks matter.
- **Practical tips:** Context caching, combining RAG with long context, and best practices for developers.
- **The future:** Predictions for superhuman coding assistants, agentic use cases, and the role of infrastructure.

## Notable Quotes

> "You can rely on context caching to make it both cheaper and faster to answer."

> "The benefit of long context for RAG is that you will be able to retrieve more relevant needles from the context by using RAG."

> "This thing is going to be incredible for coding applications."

> "Agents can be considered both consumers and suppliers for long context."
