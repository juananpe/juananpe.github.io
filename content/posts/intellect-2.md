**Key Points:**

- **Milestone:** This marks the first successful decentralized RL training of a 32B model.
- **Open Collaboration:** The training was open to compute contributions from anyone, making it fully permissionless.
- **Goal:** The project aims to scale towards frontier reasoning capabilities in areas like coding, math, and science.
- **Upcoming Release:** A full open-source release, including model checkpoints, training data, and a detailed technical report, is expected approximately one week after the announcement (made around late August 2024).
- **Community Effort:** The announcement highlighted the significant contributions from various compute providers, including Demeter*compute, string, BioProtocol, mev_pete, plaintext_cap, skre_0, oldmankotaro, plabs, ibuyrugs, 0xfr*, marloXBT, herb0x\_, mo, toptickcrypto, cannopo, samsja19, jackminong, and primeprimeint1234.
