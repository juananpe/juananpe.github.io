Rubén Fernández (@rub) recently shared insights on a Microsoft paper about AI Agent failure modes, concerned it might not get the attention it deserves. You can find his original note here: [https://substack.com/@thelearningrub/note/c-113284290](https://substack.com/@thelearningrub/note/c-113284290?utm_source=notes-share-action&r=dhjup)

He mentioned:

> I liked Microsoft's paper about Failure Modes of AI Agents, but I think it will go unnoticed by most people, so I'll prepare small infographics to showcase the information it contains.
>
> The first one, some Effects of AI Agents' failure

Here's the infographic he created summarizing some of these effects:
